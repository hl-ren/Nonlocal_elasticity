# Nonlocal-elasticity-dual-horizon-peridynamics-for-facture-modelling
Mathematica codes for nonlocal elasticity (dual-horizon non-ordinary state-based peridynamics), including library functions and numerical examples. The code is based on explicit time integration. A instability criterion based on the stability of nonlocal gradient is used for fracture modeling.
